    "Most operating systems organize files in hierarchical structures. For example, directories (also known as folders) may contain other directories and files. The Python `os` module contains some useful functions to navigate and manipulate files and directories. In the following sections, you will see how to perform some basic directory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding and changing the current working directory\n",
    "When navigating the hierarchical file system, you will always be located in a directory. The directory you're in is referred to as the \"current working directory\", or \"cwd\" for short. Python's `os.getcwd()` nethod returns a string containing the current working directory path.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working directory can be changed in Python using `os.chdir(path)`, which changes the cwd into `path`, which is a string variable containing a path to the new working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: When changing a working directory, you can specify `..` as your path. This effectively changes the working directory one level up into the parent directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Listing the content of a directory\n",
    "You might need to access or read the content of a directory. The `os.listdir()` method returns a list of the files and directories in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating and removing directories\n",
    "In Python, a new directory can be created manually using `os.mkdir(path)`, where `path` is the path and name of the new directory. Similarly, a directory can be removed using `os.rmdir(path)`, where `path` is the name of the directory to be deleted. Note that `rmdir` can delete only empty directories; if the directory specified by path is not empty, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Renaming files and directories\n",
    "Many tasks can be automated by Python. For example, if you want to rename a large number of files to match a predefined pattern, you can use Python's `os.rename(src, dst)` method, in which `src` is a string containing the path of a source file or directory, and `dst` is a string containing the new (destination) path and/or name."

    "#### Relative and absolute paths\n",
    "A file or directory has a name and a path, which is just a roadmap to its specific location in the file system. Most operating systems, support two types of paths:\n",
    "* Relative paths: path to a file or directory from a specific location (or current working directory)\n",
    "* Absolute paths: path to a file or directory from a root. In UNIX flavors, a root is \"/\"; whereas, on Windows machines a root is \"C:\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the UNIX directory structure we have been manipulating:\n",
    "\n",
    "    /\n",
    "    |\n",
    "    |__ parent_dir\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        |__  child1_dir\n",
    "        |    |\n",
    "        |    |_ leaf1.txt\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        |__ child2_dir\n",
    "        |    |\n",
    "        |    |_ leaf2.txt\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        |__ parent_leaf.txt\n",
    "        |\n",
    "        |__ text_file.txt\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you are currently in parent_dir and trying to get to leaf1.txt, the relative path would be (child1_dir/leaf1.txt). It's a relative path because it is relative to your current location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute path to leaf1.txt is (/parent_dir/child1_dir/leaf1.txt), it starts from the root \"/\" all the way to the destination file. It's absolute because it starts from the absolute root.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use relative or absolute paths; however, it might be useful to convert a relative path into an absolute path using the function `os.path.abspath(path)`. The function returns a string containing the absolute path to a file or directory specified by the relative path passed as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "In [1]: import os.path\n",
    "In [2]: os.path.abspath('child1_dir/leaf1.txt')\n",
    "Out[2]: '/parent_dir/child1_dir/leaf1.txt'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the existence of paths, files, and directories\n",
    "The module `os.path` contains common pathname manipulation functions. For example, `os.path.exists(path)` tests whether `path` (relative or absolute) exists in the file system, `os.path.isfile(path)` returns `True` if `path` (relative or absolute) refers to an existing file, and `os.path.isdir(path)` returns `True` if `path` refers to an existing directory. Other functions in the module allow you to get the size of a file, split and join path names regardless of the operating system, and so on. The Python Documentation site at https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html has more information on the `os.path` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In UNIX systems, paths are written using a forward slash (/) as separators; however, on Windows systems, paths are written using backslashes (\\\\) as separators. When joining path names, use `os.path.join` and Python will use the appropriate separator for the platform running the script.\n"
