1) Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
   Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
   Expected Result : 2
   
2) Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
   Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
   Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]
